# Facial_Recognition_Attendance_Management_System
An ML based model for teachers to take attendance using face authentication of students in the class to save time and increase instructing time.

# Motivation

Teachers find trouble in dealing with the attendance of students while doing it by hand as it uses their instructing time. We thought of using machine learning knowledge in building a model which can detect the faces of the students present in the class and mark their attendance automatically. Additionaly, it also solves the problem of proxies and students being marked present even though they are not physically present in the class. 

# Methodology

Following steps were followed to develop smart attendance management system:-

* Enrollment

* Face Detection

* Face Recognition

* Marking Attendance
